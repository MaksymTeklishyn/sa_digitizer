## Overview

**TrISS** (Transport-oriented Incremental Semiconductor Simulator) is a C++ library designed for the simulation and digitization of siliconand other semiconductor sensor signals in physics experiments and similar applications. The library provides a robust framework for modeling and analyzing the behavior of charge carriers in silicon sensors under the influence of electric and magnetic fields. This simulation is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of silicon-based detectors used in high-energy physics, medical imaging, and other scientific applications.

## Features

- **Electric Field Simulation**: Simulate the electric fields within silicon sensors using customizable field functions.
- **Charge Carrier Modeling**: Accurately model the transport of charge carriers (electrons and holes) within the sensor material.
- **Vector Field Operations**: Support for general vector field operations, allowing for complex field configurations and analyses.
- **ROOT Integration**: Leverage the ROOT framework for visualization, geometry management, and data analysis.
- **Modularity**: Highly modular design allows easy extension and customization for different sensor types and configurations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
- **ROOT Framework**: [ROOT](https://root.cern/) is required for visualization and geometry handling.
